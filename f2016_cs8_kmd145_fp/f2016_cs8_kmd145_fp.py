# Final Project

# Description:

# A customer needs to process a number of text files (called data files) that contain names and distance run by study
# participants.
# The format of those files is as follows:
#
# Max ,34.23
# Barbara ,23.00
# Luka ,12.87
#
# In those files, each row is a comma separated list of 2 values: the first one is the name of the participant and the
# second is the distance that the participant has run.
# The names of the input files are stored one per line in an additional file, called the master input list.
# This file has the following structure:
#
# <data file 1>
# <data file 2>
# <data file 3>
# â€¦
#
# Write a program that read the master input list file, retrieves the names of the data files and from each one of them
# reads every line, extract name and distance. Once the program has all the data in memory, it has to compute the
# following quantities and informations:
# - number of files read in input
# - total number of lines read
# - total distance run (aka the sum of all the distances loaded from provided files)
# - total distance run for each individual participant
# - individual maximum distance run and by which participant
# - individual minimum distance run and by which participant
# - report if there are any participants that appears more than once, how many times and their names
# - total number of participants
#
# The program should provide an terminal output similar to the following:
#
#	Number of Input files read   : xx
#	Total number of lines read   : xx
#
#	total distance run           : xxxx.xxxxx
#
#	max distance run             : xxxx.xxxxx
#	  by participant             : participant name
#
#	min distance run             : xxxx.xxxxx
#	  by participant             : participant name
#
#	Total number of participants : xx
#	Number of participants
#    with multiple records       : xx
#
# The program should also create an output file reporting name of the participant, how many times their name appears in
# the input files and the total distance run. Each row should be as follows:
#
# Max,3,124.23
# Barbara,2,65.00
# Luka,1,12.87

# Use a class named participants that has 2 properties:
# name: name of the participant. String.
# distance: accumulator for total distance run by the participant. Float.
# runs: accumulator for the total number of runs run by the participant.
# Use the following methods:
# addDistance(d)
# add single distance to the distance accumulator and increments runs by 1. Argument d is a single float.
# addDistances(ld)
# add an array of distances to distance accumulator. Argument ld is a list of floats.
# getDistance()
# get the current value of the distance accumulator.
# getName()
# get the name of the participant of the current instance
# __init__ (n,d=0)
# initializer method. set name and initial distance if provided. If initial distance is not specified, it should be set
# to zero
# __str__()
# stringify method. Returns a string with name, total distance run and how many distances the object added, according
# to the following format:
# Name : xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. Distance run : yyyy.yyyy. Runs : zzzz
# where xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx is a right align string of 20 characters for the name,
# yyyy.yyyy is the total distance run with 9 digits, decimal point and 4 decimals,
# and zzzz is the number of runs with 4 digits, no decimals.
