# Description:
# This project contains exercises for chapter 2 that were assigned in class.
#
# Notes:
# I am confused with the input function. How is input supposed to be entered? Also, since I have never programmed
# before, I am not sure if what I am doing is correct, but I tried to follow the book's examples. I also tried to use
# line continuation/backslash character, but I kept getting an error message.
